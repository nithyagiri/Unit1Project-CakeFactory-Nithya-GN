                    💡 Why We Started
                     We saw how stressful and time-consuming it could be to find the perfect cake — calling bakeries, browsing outdated websites, and hoping 
                     for the best.So we built Cake Factory to simplify the process, empower customers with choice, and support local bakers with a modern platform.
